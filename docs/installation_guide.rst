Installation Guide
==================

Installing the repository version from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ is as simple as

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pydsge


Caveats
-------

* The package is *not* backwards compatible with Python 2.x. 
* There seems to be an issue with parallel estimations under windows. See `this issue <https://github.com/gboehl/pydsge/issues/20`_ for possible workarounds
