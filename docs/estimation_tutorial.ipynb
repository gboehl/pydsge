However, not all defaults are always a good good choice, and to showcase some of this functionality, we decide to specify several arguments here.\n",

Again,  the default filter is non-linear, but we can opt for a linear one by setting the argument `linear` to `True`. To choose a custom number of ensemble members for the TEnKF, set `N` to a particular number (default is 300, for e.g. a medium scale model 400-500 is a good choice). We can also set a specific random seed with the argument `seed` (the default seed is `0`). To get additional information on the estimation process, we can set  `verbose` to `True`. Conveniently, this information includes an overview of the parameters’ distribution, their means and standard deviations. Finally, if we already specified the covariance matrix of the measurement errors or want to reuse a previous result, we can load it into the `prep_estim` method by setting `Load.R` to `True`. \n",
