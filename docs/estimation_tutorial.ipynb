Again,  the default filter is non-linear, but we can opt for a linear one by setting the argument `Linear` to `True`. To choose a custom number of ensemble members for the TEnKF, set `N` to a particular number (default is 300). We can also set a specific `seed`, the default seed is `0`. To get additional information on the estimation process, we can set  `verbose` to `True`. Conveniently, this information includes an overview of the parameters’ distribution, their means and standard deviations. Moreover, if we already specified the covariance matrix of the measurement errors or want to reuse a previous result, we can load it into the `prep_estim` method by setting `Load.R` to `True`. Finally, we can turn parallelization on or off with the debug argument, which can be helpful in case any issues should arise.\n"

    "Now that the we have all the variables and defined the type of estimation to perform, we can turn to estimating the model. To be able to deal with very high-dimensional models, `pdygse` uses *Markov Chain Monte Carlo* (MCMC) Integration to sample from the posterior distribution. For further information on MCMC, please refer to the `emcee` [website](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the additional resources provided there. We recommend running a **Tempered Ensemble MCMC** first, by using the `tmcmc` method. Doing this is particularly valuable for high-dimensional problems, since defining the initial states of the walkers in the parameterspace in this way is a powerful tool to improve sampling. However, due to its computational efficiency, we also use it for small models such as the one we are dealing with here."

Here we do not want to set a target and, in turn, set `fmax = None`. Moreover, we have the option to set different \"moves\", i.e. coordinate updating algorithms for the walkers. As a wrapper for a lot of `emcee` functionality,  `tmcmc` can work with many different \"moves\" - for a list and implementation details please consult the `emcee` documentation. For using them here, specify them as a list of tuples, containing the type of move and its \"weight\". If no move is specified, \"StretchMove\" is used. For seed setting of the log probability, the user can choose between three options, here we use the seed specified in `prep_estim`<span style=\"color:Red\">**@Gregor, check again** </span>.
