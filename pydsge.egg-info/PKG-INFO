----

Contains the functions and classes for solving, filtering and estimating DSGE models at the ZLB (or with other occasionally binding constraints).

A collection of models that can be (and were) used with this package can be found in `another repo <https://github.com/gboehl/projectlib/tree/master/yamls>`_.

Installation
-------------

Installing the stable version is as simple as

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pydsge

Documentation
-------------

There is some `documentation <https://pydsge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ out there.

- `Installation Guide <https://pydsge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_guide.html>`_
- `Getting Started <https://pydsge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_
- `Module Documentation <https://pydsge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html>`_

Citation
--------

**pydsge** is developed by Gregor Boehl to simulate, filter, and estimate DSGE models with the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates in various applications (see `my website <https://gregorboehl.com>`_ for research papers using the package). Please cite it with

.. code-block:: latex

We appreciate citations for **pydsge** because it helps us to find out how people have
been using the package and it motivates further work.


Parser
------

The parser originally was a fork of Ed Herbst's fork from Pablo Winant's (excellent) package **dolo**.
